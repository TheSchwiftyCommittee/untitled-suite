- As an admin, I to have access to the admin dashboard.

**Solution:**

Admin will be able to log into the application and have access to an onboard dashboard. This will act as a hub in which all admin, can access the application through a unique way. The Admin dashboard will only be accessible to users who have the status of admin. Other uses will not have access or vision of the dashboard within their experience of the application.

**Solution:**

Within the Admin dashboard, admin have access to all current users within the application's database. The dashboard will not only display all users but allow admin to perform various actions ( mentioned below).

**Solution:**

One action available within the dashboard to all Admin is the ability to delete any user. The ability to delete an account will only be exercised if said user has broken, violated the terms and conditions of the application. The deletion of any user is a permanent action and can not be undone once performed.

The Admin dashboard allows the Admin to also promote users to Admin status. This feature allows for the growth of the admin staff as the growth of the application increases. This action is should be performed with caution and only be used once a user has gone through sufficient screening.
